                <li>Thalassemia  is a genetic disorder that causes your body to have poorly developed  haemoglobin than normal. </li>
                <li>Haemoglobin (Hb) enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. </li>
                <li>The disorder results in excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anaemia. Anaemia is a condition in which your body doesn't have enough normal, healthy red blood cells.</li>
                <li>Thalassemia is inherited, meaning that at least one of your parents must be a carrier of the disorder. It's caused by either a genetic mutation or a deletion of certain key gene fragments.</li>
                <li>Thalassemia minor is a carrier stage of genes; it is less serious form of the disorder. </li>
                <li>There are two main forms of thalassemia that are more serious. In alpha thalassemia, at least one of the alpha globin genes has a mutation or abnormality. In beta thalassemia, the beta globin genes are affected.</li>
                <li>Thallassemia testing can be done at Samarpan Path lab.</li>
                <li>Monetary donation portal for Thalassemia children.</li>
                <li>MEF project with details,portal to enrol in MEF project.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br />

		<p><b>The symptoms of thalassemia can vary. Some of the most common ones include:</b></p>        
        <ul class="ul_1">                         	
                <li>Bone deformities, especially in the face.</li>
                <li>Dark urine.</li>
                <li>delayed growth and development.</li>
                <li>excessive tiredness and fatigue.</li>
                <li>yellow or pale skin.</li>
            </ul>
            
             <p>Not everyone has visible symptoms of thalassemia. Signs of the disorder also tend to show up later in childhood or adolescence.</p>

            <p>Thalassemia occurs when there's an abnormality or mutation in one of the genes involved in hemoglobin production. You inherit this genetic abnormality from your parents.</p> 
              <p>If only one of your parents is a carrier for thalassemia, you may develop a form of the disease known as thalassemia minor. If this occurs, you probably won't have symptoms, but you'll be a carrier. Some people with thalassemia minor do develop minor symptoms.</p> 
               <p>If  both of your parents are carriers of thalassemia, you have a greater chance of inheriting a more serious form of the disease.</p> 
                <p>Thalassemia is most common Trusted Source in people from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey.</p>

            <p>If your doctor is trying to diagnose thalassemia, they'll likely take a blood sample. They'll send this sample to a lab to be tested for anemia and abnormal hemoglobin. A lab technician will also look at the blood under a microscope to see if the red blood cells are oddly shaped.</p> 
              <p>Abnormally shaped red blood cells are a sign of thalassemia. The lab technician may also perform a test known as hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test separates out the different molecules in the red blood cells, allowing them to identify the abnormal type.</p> 
               <p>Depending on the type and severity of the thalassemia, a physical examination might also help your doctor make a diagnosis. For example, a severely enlarged spleen might suggest to your doctor that you have hemoglobin H disease.</p>

            <p>The treatment for thalassemia depends on the type and severity of disease involved. Your doctor will give you a course of treatment that will work best for your particular case.</p> 
            
            <p>Some of the treatments include:</p>
            
            <ul class="ul_1">                         	
                <li>Blood transfusions</li>
                <li>Bone marrow transplant</li>
                <li>Medications and supplements</li>
                <li>Possible surgery to remove the spleen or gallbladder</li>
            </ul>
            
            
                <p>Your doctor may instruct you not to take vitamins or supplements containing iron. This is especially true if you need blood transfusions because people who receive them accumulate extra iron that the body can't easily get rid of. Iron can build up in tissues, which can be potentially fatal.</p> 
                <p>If you're receiving a blood transfusion, you may also need chelation therapy. This generally involves receiving an injection of a chemical that binds with iron and other heavy metals. This helps remove extra iron from your body.</p>

             <br />
           
            
            <p>A low-fat, plant-based diet is the best choice for most people, including those with thalassemia. However, you may need to limit iron-rich foods if you already have high iron levels in your blood. Fish and meats are rich in iron, so you may need to limit these in your diet.</p>
            
            <p>You may also consider avoiding fortified cereals, breads, and juices. They contain high iron levels, too.</p>
            
            
            <p>Thalassemia can cause folic acid (folate) deficiencies. Naturally found in foods such as dark leafy greens and legumes, this B vitamin is essential for warding off the effects of high iron levels and protecting red blood cells. If you're not getting enough folic acid in your diet, your doctor may recommend a 1 mg supplement taken daily.</p>
            <p>There's no one diet that can cure thalassemia, but making sure you eat the right foods can help. Be sure to discuss any dietary changes with your doctor ahead of time.</p>

             <br />
           
            
            <p>Since thalassemia is a genetic disorder, there's no way to prevent it. However, there are ways you can manage the disease to help prevent complications.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to ongoing medical care, the CDC recommendsTrusted Source that all individuals with disorder protect themselves from infections by keeping up with the following vaccines:</p>
            
             <ul class="ul_1">
            	<li>Homophiles influenza type b</li>
                <li>Hepatitis</li>
                <li>Meningococcal</li>
                <li>Pneumococcal</li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p>In addition to a healthy diet, regular exercise can help manage your symptoms and lead to a more positive prognosis. Moderate-intensity workouts are usually recommended, since heavy exercise can make your symptoms worse.</p>
            <p>Walking and bike riding are examples of moderate-intensity workouts. Swimming and yoga are other options, and they're also good for your joints. The key is to find something you enjoy and keep moving.</p>

             <br />
           
            
            <p>Thalassemia is a serious illness that can lead to life-threatening complications when left untreated or undertreated. While it's difficult to pinpoint an exact life expectancy, the general rule is that the more severe the condition, the quicker thalassemia can become fatal.</p>
            
            
            <p>According to some estimates, people with beta thalassemia — the most severe form — typically die by age 30. The shortened life span has to do with iron overload, which can eventually affect your organs.</p>
            
            <p>Researchers are continuing to explore genetic testing as well as the possibility of gene therapy. The earlier thalassemia is detected, the sooner you can receive treatment. In the future, gene therapy could possibly reactivate hemoglobin and deactivate abnormal gene mutations in the body.</p>

             <br />
           
            
            <p>Thalassemia also brings up different concerns related to pregnancy. The disorder affects reproductive organ development. Because of this, women with thalassemia may encounter fertility difficulties.</p>
            
            <p>To ensure the health of both you and your baby, it's important to plan ahead of time as much as possible. If you want to have a baby, discuss this with your doctor to make sure that you're in the best health possible.</p>
            
            <p>Your iron levels will need to be carefully monitored. Preexisting issues with major organs are also considered.</p>
            
            <p>Prenatal testing for thalassemia may be done at 11 and 16 weeks. This is done by taking fluid samples from either the placenta or the fetus, respectively.</p>
            <p>Pregnancy carries the following risk factors in women with thalassemia:</p>
            
            
             <ul class="ul_1">
            	<li>A higher risk for infections</li>

<p>Due to Fatal effects of HCV infection we had run HCV treatment project at our Day Care center for 45 Thalassemics who were HCV positive.</p>
<p>In 2013 when Interferon injections was the only source of treatment,we had 70% success in the project.</p>
<p>With remaining positive children we run the project again in 2015 with new drugs in tablet form.</p>
<p>Our project had 100% success.</p>

Blood is life; Blood plays the role of creating, conserving and protecting life. The different components of blood have different roles to play.

                <li>Blood is made up of: 
                	<ol>
                    	<li><b>Plasma</b>: the fluid part which carries all the nutrients to the tissues of the body and takes away all the waste matter, which enables the blood to flow. </li>
                        <li><b>Platelets</b>: ensures that, in the event of bleeding, a clot is formed to prevent further blood loss. </li>
                        <li><b>W.B.Cs</b>: the defence mechanism of the body. They protect the body from external attacks and are also called as the 'soldier' cells. </li>
                        <li><b>R.B.Cs</b>: contain haemoglobin, which carries the oxygen that we breathe to the different parts of the body. In fact the red colour of blood is due to RBCs. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>This is caused due to the inability to produce haemoglobin, leading to premature destruction of RBCs.</li>
                <li>Therefore life-giving oxygen is not supplied to the various tissues, that will die as a result</li>
                <li>The child therefore needs blood transfusions, which have to be given throughout life-on an average every 15 days. </li>
                <li>A Thalassaemic Major Child is born only if both parents are Thalassaemia Minor. </li>
